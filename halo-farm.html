	<h1>What's Behind Our Low Prices?</h1>
	<p id="history">Halo Farm was started by Jerry Reilly who had previously been president of a large food company. He saw first hand the exessive costs of trucking perishable foods for miles and miles. His idea was to build a dairy with a store attached - no trucks on the road. The concept was realized in 1975 - a modern dairy without trucks. The result LOW PRICES and higher QUALITY.</p> 

	<br>

	<ul>
		<li> We improve freshness by several days. </li>
		<li> Our milk is tastier because we buy from small family owned dairy farms. </li>
		<li>We don't use undesireable additives. No stabilizers, no preservatives, no artificial colors, no artificial flavors.</li>
		<li>We use very expensive ingredients and still keep our prices very, very low.</li>
	</ul>
